### Hi there ðŸ‘‹<br><br>

ðŸ”­ I'm currently focused in helping businesses to scale and thrive as an Investor and Board Member.<br>
I'm also (slowly) developing an investment management platform... You can follow the progress in the CurryInv repository.<br>
I have spent 32 years working for BTG Pactual, a brazilian investment bank, where I developed a successful carrear from junior developer to head of development and Co-CTO. I have also lead some business areas. In the last years I was leading infosec and data analytics, wich I've started structuring in 2017. My full experience can be viewed in my [![linkedin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linkedin-0072b1?style=plastic&logo=Linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reinogueira/) profile.<br><br>
